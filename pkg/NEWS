2012-06-12: - conditional simulation in 3d implemented
2012-06-12: - anisotropy for three-dimensional simulation implemented
2012-06-11: - anisotropy for two-dimensional simulation in single precision added
2012-06-11: - three dimensional unconditional simulation in double precision implemented as .sim3d()
2012-05-30: - Matern3 and Matern5 covariance functions added
2012-05-30: - Double precision for FFT and Simulation
2011-12-04: - Performance of conditional simulation improved, the sample covariance matrix is not any longer inverted by solve(), solve() is only used for solving the equation system of the sample covariance matrix and the data residuals to the unconditional realizations.
